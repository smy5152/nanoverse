# Project Name: DIRECTORY SEARCH AND LISTING - WEBSITE LAYOUT

Visitors are expected to use this as a Directory service website to shortlist matching schools to take Software and IT related courses.
The website aims to be a layout concept for a directory search and results listing page for finding information. I have implemented the concept for Online Software Development Courses & Results list shortlisted/filtered online schools that are detailed further when you view one result card. There are placeholders to include ratings, ranking, locations, application process, website, contact info & Map gps location.
